## Launch

Microlaba currently stores all user data in cookies, so it doesnâ€™t matter through which server you run it.

But the kit includes a simple Node.js server; to launch it, of course, you need Node.js itself and enter the following command in the console running in the project folder:
```bash
node index.js
```
